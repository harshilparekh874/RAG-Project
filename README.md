# **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Python and Machine Learning**

This project implements a technical pipeline to enhance LLM responses using vector embeddings and semantic retrieval. The following sections detail the key components of the system:

---

## **1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**

- **CSV Loading & Structuring:**  
  Utilizes **Pandas** to load a CSV dataset (e.g., top-rated wines) and converts each row into a dictionary format, ensuring compatibility for downstream vectorization.

- **Data Normalization:**  
  Applies text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization to prepare raw text for embedding.

---

## **2. Embedding Generation**

- **Vectorization:**  
  Leverages Hugging Face’s `SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")` to convert preprocessed text into high-dimensional dense embeddings that capture semantic context.

- **Batch Processing:**  
  Implements efficient batch processing to generate embeddings for large datasets.

---

## **3. Vector Database Setup & Retrieval**

- **Indexing:**  
  Stores the generated embeddings in **Qdrant**, an in-memory vector database optimized for rapid similarity searches.

- **Semantic Search:**  
  Configures cosine similarity or Euclidean distance metrics for retrieving the most relevant context for a given query.

---

## **4. LLM Integration & Augmentation**

- **Context Injection:**  
  Retrieves contextually relevant documents from Qdrant based on query embedding similarity and passes them as supplementary context to the LLM.

- **LLM Connectivity:**  
  Connects to a local LLM via **Llamafile** or integrates with **OpenAI’s API**, facilitating on-the-fly generation of enhanced responses.

---

## **5. System Evaluation & Iterative Refinement**

- **Pipeline Testing:**  
  Performs rigorous testing using real-world queries to evaluate retrieval accuracy and response relevance.

- **Feedback Loop:**  
  Incorporates performance metrics and user feedback to iteratively fine-tune data preprocessing, embedding strategies, and retrieval parameters.

This detailed RAG pipeline exemplifies how combining efficient data preprocessing, neural embeddings, vector database indexing, and dynamic LLM integration can produce contextually enriched and highly accurate chatbot responses.
